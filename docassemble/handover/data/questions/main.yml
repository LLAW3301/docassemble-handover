  LLAW3301: Law in a Digital Age - Application Handover
content: |
  Dear ${MJFclients.clients_list[i]['recipient'].name.first.strip()},

  Thanks for your support this semester for *LLAW3301: Law in a Digital Age*.

  The semester has now completed and your application is ready for you to review and
  to use 'live' should you wish to do so.

  Please find below a link to the final version of your app and also to a short
  Presentation Video prepared by your student group for you:

  * Link to your app: [${MJFclients.clients_list[i]['app_name']}](${MJFclients.clients_list[i]['app_link']})
  * Link to [Presentation Video](${MJFclients.clients_list[i]['video_link']})

  **Please Note:**  The linked version of your app
  is currently hosted on our teaching servers.  We recommend that you do
  not use this app for production purposes until you have commissioned your own version
  as we cannot guarantee the availability of our teaching servers, particularly during
  non-teaching periods.

  This email commences the process for handing over your application (${MJFclients.clients_list[i]['app_name']}),
  to you for use by you in a live production environment.  An overview of the 
  entire handover process is available in 
  [this document](https://flinders-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/ferr0182_flinders_edu_au/Ee6uHLscUOZAmm8P9mBIHwkBI0YTQyfVEOp5DZLnORaakg?e=AhDq8L).

  The first step in this process is to register your intent to commission your app
  into production (should you wish to do so).

  Please 
  [register your intent](${MJFclients.clients_list[i]['interview_URL']})
  (or otherwise) to commission
  your application. You will receive an email confirming your intentions.

  If you do not wish to take the applications developed for you into production,
  you have the option to continue to work with us in subsequent semesters, or to
  refine the applications developed for you to make them production ready. 
  You will be able to indicate this once you click on the link above.

  If you do wish to take your application into production, your receipt will
  include a pro forma Application Review Form (as described in the
  [Handover Process document](https://flinders-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/ferr0182_flinders_edu_au/Ee6uHLscUOZAmm8P9mBIHwkBI0YTQyfVEOp5DZLnORaakg?e=AhDq8L)
  ).
  Please complete this form ${ arf_completion_date }
  and bring it with you to your Review Meeting.

  Subject to a timely registration, you should receive an 
  email confirming your Review Meeting ${ rm_notif_date }.

  Please contact me if you have any questions.
